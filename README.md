Smash
=====

Voting system based on Facebook Smash, aka, Facesmash (the predecessor of Facebook), using Smarty Framework. (https://www.colocationamerica.com/picts/blog/facemash.jpg).
My friend and I created a small online store to sell books to a specific public on Brazil, due the lack of stores in the country, compared to the abundant number in USA. 

**Beware, the full catalog may contain adult flavoured content, and might be sensible for all audiences due its nature.**

This code does not come with a database, so the navigation is safe and clean. A Layout.jpg were provided to illustrate the final look.


WHAT TO OBSERVE HERE
--------------------

PHP Code: We are testing Smarty, so basically we have templates and code behind pages. The Smarty Framework is NOT present in this repository, so you might want to fork it. This code is more for learning and browsing, not executing.

HTML: We were very worried about SEO here. SEO Doctor evaluated this system as 100% SEO efficient. Cheers!


CSS
---
This is not the best CSS you will see, we let one of our friends to play with for learning purposes, so you will not see the best practices here.
